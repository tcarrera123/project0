      <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
      <img src="hardhat.png" width=50%>
      <p>Hello, World! Ever wonder who builds the massive buildings, bridges, roads, or how water arrives to sinks/sprinklers? To begin, civil engineering has existed for a long time. In fact, it can be traced back as far as 4000 and 2000 B.C.; making civil engineering one of the oldest types of engineering. Today, civil engineers have built all that is around us such as the markings/signs on the street, pipes to carry water to cities, schools, houses, etc. Therefore, they have a huge
      responsibility to society. Through examining background information, one can see that civil engineering is defined as a field of engineering, with several sub-divisions, whose priority is to maintain the safety of the people.</p>

        <p span class="para">Leonardo da Vinci is known as one of the greatest painters to ever walk on Earth but he had many other titles as well. As an engineer he was able to create many technical drawings. He was working as an engineer at one time and was able to protect a city from an attack due to his set up of moveable baracades. Leonardo's journal was filled with inventions which included hydraulic pumps, steam cannon, and many more. Much later his designs were tested and were found to perform successfully to fairly well. He was able to trace back to inventions of the past and reconstruct them to a totally new invention.</p>

        <p span class="para">Professor Cross was able to find a method for indeterminate structures called "Hardy Cross Method". He graduated as a civil engineer from M.I.T and did graduate study in Harvard. Later he became an assistant professor for Brown University. Soon he became a professor for structural engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he developed the "Hardy Cross Method". At the University of Yale he served as the chair of the civil engineering department. He has received many awards for his work.</p>

        <p span class="para">Governor Alexander was the first african american to graduate from the college of engineering of the University of Iowa while playing football. He studied bridge design and soon started his own company called Alexander & Repass; where he completed Whitehurst Freeway (U.S. Route 29), Tidal Basin Bridge, and many others. In 1946, Howard University awarded him honorary Doctor of Engineering. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to governor of the United States Virgin Islands.</p></div>
